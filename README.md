## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+ ([python.org](https://python.org))
- That's it. Everything else installs automatically.

### macOS / Linux

```bash
cd tradejournal
bash start_mac.sh
```

### Windows

Double-click `start_windows.bat`

The app opens automatically at **http://localhost:5000**

## Syncing Between Machines

This repo is your sync mechanism. Your trade data lives in `data/journal.db` which is **git-ignored** (it contains your personal trade data).

To move data between machines:
1. **Settings → DB Admin → Export** downloads a `.sql` backup file
2. Copy that file to your other machine
3. **Settings → DB Admin → Import** restores it

Or manually copy `data/journal.db` between machines.

### Architecture

Three-layer separation — no layer reaches into another's domain:

| Layer | File | Responsibility |
|-------|------|---------------|
| **HTTP** | `server.py` | Flask routes, request/response handling |
| **Logic** | `app_logic.py` | CSV parsing, trade reconstruction, risk math, live trade calculations |
| **Data** | `database.py` | SQLite schema, queries, migrations |

---

## Importing Trades

1. Export fills from your broker as CSV or Excel
2. Dashboard → drag file onto the import zone (or click it)
3. Trades are reconstructed using FIFO position tracking

### Required CSV columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `B/S` | `Buy` or `Sell` |
| `avgPrice` | Fill price |
| `filledQty` | Number of contracts |
| `Fill Time` | Datetime (`MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS`) |
| `Date` | Trade date |

The included `Orders19.csv` is a sample you can import immediately.

## Live Trade Entry

The Ticket UI (`/live`) is a single-page interface designed for speed during active trading:

- **Command Bar** — Toggle direction/instrument/mode, enter price + qty, press Enter
- **One-Click Exits** — TP1/TP2/TP3 buttons pre-filled with price, qty, and P&L estimate
- **Inline Price Editing** — Click any stop/target price in the position map to edit
- **Trail Stops** — Per-portion stop adjustment with instant risk recalculation
- **Push to Journal** — Explicitly saves trade with fills, tags, and notes to the main journal

The legacy form-based UI is still available at `/live-legacy`.

## Theme System

9 built-in themes configurable in **Settings → Theme**:

| Theme | Style | Best for |

## Data and Backup

All data is stored locally in `data/journal.db` (SQLite).

**Backup options:**
- Settings → DB Admin → Export (downloads `.sql` file)
- Copy `data/journal.db` directly
- Both methods are lossless round-trips

No internet connection required after first run.
